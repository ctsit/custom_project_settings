REDCap Custom Project Settings would not be possible without generous contributions from our authors and funders.

David R Nelson, Director of the University of Florida Clinical Translational Science Institute, provides funding support for the UF CTSI REDCap team via UF CTSA Award and matching funds from the UF Office of Research.

The authors would like to thank Teddy S. Youn, MD and Katharina Busl, M.D., M.S. of the Division of Neurocritical Care at University of Florida and Andy Martin for the concepts behind the creation of this software.

Philip Chase (philipbchase@gmail.com) was the principal designer on the project. Initial development work was done by Prasad Lanka <planka@ufl.edu> and Surya Prasanna <suryayalla@ufl.edu>.  We also want to thank Dileep Rajput <rajputd@ufl.edu>, Taryn Stoffs <tls@ufl.edu>, and Stewart Wehmeyer <swehmeyer@ufl.edu> for their contributions to the project.
